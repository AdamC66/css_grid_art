# CSS Grid Art

For this exercise, you will be creating an *abstract work of art* using CSS Grid!  More specifically, you will be attempting to recreate a piece called *Composition with Red Blue and Yellow* by Piet Mondrian.  

Some of the basic templating been done for you.  Your job is to resize and recolor the `div`s to make look similar to the original piece.  You don't need to recreate the image exactly - there's a lot of subtlety here - for now just focus on matching the general cell width and colors.  

Use the [painting](img/mondrian-composition-ii.jpg) or the image of [one possible solution](img/css-solution.png) for guidance.  

### Steps to clone down and open
1. Open up Terminal
2. Change into your `exercises` directory
3. `git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/css_grid_art.git`
4. `cd css_grid_art` to change into the cloned down directory
5. `code .` to open the directory you are currently located in VS Code

### Bonus!

Create your own Mondrian-inspired works of art using CSS Grid from scratch!  You can create a new git branch with `git checkout -b branch-name`, delete the `div`s and styling and start from scratch!
