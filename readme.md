# CSS Grid Art

For this exercise, you will be creating an *abstract work of art* using CSS Grid!  More specifically, you will be attempting to recreate a piece called *Composition with Red Blue and Yellow* by Piet Mondrian.  

Some of the basic templating been done for you.  Your job is to resize and recolor the `div`s to make look similar to the original piece.  You don't need to recreate the image exactly - there's a lot of subtlety here - for now just focus on matching the general cell width and colors.  

Use the [painting](mondrian-composition-ii.jpg) or the image of [one possible solution](css-solution.png) for guidance.
